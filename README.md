jeketnunc is a theme for Jekyll websites, specifically designed for use by artists on the HicEtNunc platform.

## Easy Deployment Tutorial
The [**jeketnunc-github-pages-template**](https://github.com/jeketnunc/jeketnunc-github-pages-template) repository can be cloned by any GitHub user. If properly named, it will instantly generate a GitHub Pages website using the jeketnunc template.
The MathMakesArt Blog has a [**tutorial blogpost**](https://mathmakes.art/blog/2020/04/10/how-to-create-your-own-jeketnunc-website.html) showing how to deploy your own website from that tempate repository.

## GitHub Pages
You can implement **jeketnunc** as the theme of your own GitHub Pages website by including the following line in your **_config.yml**:
 - `remote_theme: jeketnunc/jeketnunc@main`

You must also include the `jekyll-remote-theme` plugin within this same configuration file, as part of the `site.plugins` variable.

## Example Implementation
The [**MathMakesArt Website**](https://mathmakes.art) is the reason I created the **jeketnunc** Jekyll theme in the first place.

It implements **jeketnunc** as its theme and is hosted on GitHub Pages via the [**mathMakesArt/mathmakesart.github.io**](https://github.com/mathMakesArt/mathmakesart.github.io) repository.
